## Bio
I'm a fourth year PhD Candidate in the Department of Genetic Medicine at Johns Hopkins. 
I use (mostly) transcriptomic data to study age- and disease- associated changes in the enteric nervous
system. I'm passionate about open science and promoting reproducible computational research.

Check out my contributions to our [recent preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.262832v1.full), where we identified and
characterized a mesoderm-derived population of ganglionic cells that contribute to the enteric nervous system!

## Education
2019 B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, George Washington University

2019-current PhD Candidate in Human Genetics- Advisor: Loyal Goff
